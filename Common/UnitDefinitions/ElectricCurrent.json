  "XmlDocSummary": "An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma.",
  "XmlDocRemarks": "If you want to map more parameters into the <c>ElectricCurrent</c> class (amps RMS, phase angle, etc.), create your own wrapper type such as a record or named tuple.",
