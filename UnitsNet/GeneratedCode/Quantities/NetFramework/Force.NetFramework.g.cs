//     Add CustomCode\Quantities\MyQuantity.extra.cs files to add code to generated quantities.
//     Add Extensions\MyQuantityExtensions.cs to decorate quantities with new behavior.
//     Add UnitDefinitions\MyQuantity.json and run GeneratUnits.bat to generate new units or quantities.

    ///     In physics, a force is any influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical construction. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate, or a flexible object to deform, or both. Force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.
